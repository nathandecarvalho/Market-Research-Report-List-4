<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tyre Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct TPMS</li><li>Indirect TPMS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Tyre Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) is divided into two main types - Direct TPMS and Indirect TPMS. Direct TPMS uses sensors within each tire to directly measure tire pressure and transmit data to the vehicle's computer system. Indirect TPMS, on the other hand, does not use sensors and instead relies on the vehicle's anti-lock braking system to monitor tire pressure based on wheel speed and other factors. Both systems help ensure optimal tire pressure, improve safety, and enhance fuel efficiency.</p></p>
