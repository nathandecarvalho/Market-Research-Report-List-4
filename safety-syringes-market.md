<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Safety Syringes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Retractable</li><li>Non Retractable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Safety syringes are categorized into two main types - retractable and non-retractable. Retractable syringes have a mechanism that automatically retracts the needle into the syringe barrel after use, reducing the risk of needlestick injuries. On the other hand, non-retractable syringes do not have this mechanism and require manual removal and disposal of the needle. Both types aim to enhance safety for healthcare professionals and patients by minimizing the risk of accidental needlestick injuries and preventing the reuse of needles.</p></p>
