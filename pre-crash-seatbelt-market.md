<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pre-Crash Seatbelt Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Preload Type Belt</li><li>Preroll Preload Type Belt</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pre-Crash seatbelt systems include Preload Type Belts and Preroll Preload Type Belts. Preload Type Belts automatically tighten the seatbelt to hold the occupant securely in place before a crash occurs, reducing the risk of injury. Preroll Preload Type Belts also tighten before impact, but they use a mechanism to retract the seatbelt slightly during braking to prepare for a potential collision. Both types of seatbelt systems aim to enhance occupant safety in the event of an accident.</p></p>
