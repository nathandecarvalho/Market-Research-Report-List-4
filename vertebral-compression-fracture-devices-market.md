<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vertebral Compression Fracture Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Balloon Kyphoplasty Devices</li><li>Vertebroplasty Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vertebral compression fracture devices are used to treat spinal fractures caused by osteoporosis or other conditions. Balloon kyphoplasty devices involve inflating a balloon in the fractured vertebrae to create a cavity before injecting bone cement to stabilize the bone. Vertebroplasty devices involve injecting bone cement directly into the fractured vertebrae without the use of a balloon. Both types of devices help to relieve pain, stabilize the spine, and improve mobility for patients suffering from vertebral compression fractures.</p></p>
