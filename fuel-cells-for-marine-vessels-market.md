<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fuel Cells for Marine Vessels Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC)</li><li>Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fuel cells for marine vessels come in two main types: Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) and Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC). PEMFCs are lightweight and operate at low temperatures, making them suitable for smaller boats. SOFCs, on the other hand, are more efficient and can run on multiple fuels, but operate at higher temperatures, making them better suited for larger ships. Both types are being increasingly adopted in the marine industry due to their clean and efficient power generation capabilities.</p></p>
