<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Immune Checkpoint Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Anti-PD-L1 Drug</li><li>Anti-PD-1 Drug</li><li>CTLA4</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Immune checkpoint agents are a type of cancer immunotherapy that helps the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells. The three main types of immune checkpoint agents are Anti-PD-L1 drugs, Anti-PD-1 drugs, and CTLA4 inhibitors. Anti-PD-L1 drugs block the PD-L1 protein on cancer cells, preventing them from evading immune detection. Anti-PD-1 drugs target the PD-1 protein on T cells, enhancing their ability to attack cancer cells. CTLA4 inhibitors block the CTLA4 protein, boosting immune responses against cancer.</p></p>
